# SmartNotes Project Description

SmartNotes is an intelligent note-taking and content summarization platform designed to help users efficiently process, understand, and interact with various forms of media content. The application supports multiple content types including YouTube videos, PDF documents, audio files, video files, and live meeting transcriptions, automatically extracting transcripts or text content and generating comprehensive AI-powered summaries using advanced language models. Once a summary is created, the system automatically processes the original transcript or document content by chunking it into manageable segments and generating vector embeddings using Google's Gemini embedding model, which are then stored in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database for efficient retrieval. 

**The core purpose of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in SmartNotes** is to enable an interactive, context-aware question-answering system that goes beyond simple summarization. When users ask questions about the summarized content through the "Ask AI" chat interface, RAG retrieves the most relevant chunks from the original transcript or document based on semantic similarity to the user's query, rather than relying solely on the pre-generated summary. This approach ensures that responses are grounded in the actual source material, providing accurate, detailed answers to specific questions while maintaining context from the full content. By combining the retrieval of relevant document chunks with a large language model (LLM), RAG allows users to engage in natural conversations about the content, ask follow-up questions, explore specific topics in depth, and extract precise information that may not have been included in the initial summary. This transforms SmartNotes from a passive summarization tool into an interactive knowledge assistant that helps users deeply understand and extract value from their saved content, making it particularly valuable for students, researchers, professionals, and anyone who needs to quickly comprehend and reference information from lengthy videos, documents, or meetings.
